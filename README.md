# Intro to Raspberry Pi Workshop
All material needed to run the beginner Raspberry Pi workshop can be found in this repository.

*Steps to organizing this workshop:*
1. Book a computer lab at least 3 weeks before. (BSB 249 is a good option)
2. Start promoting at least 2 weeks before. 
   * Create google form to register participants.
   * Establish payment process.
   * Announce to IEEE members as part of office hour duties.
3. Ask for volunteers (ideally 5, one per station and one general floater)
4. Train volunteers the week of the workshop. 
    * Poll for training date and time.
    * Book a lab for volunteer training. (JHE labs are nice)
5. Assign a lead to present introduction slides.
6. Email participants with details and agenda of workshop 2 days before. (Date, time, agenda, building and room location)
7. Pre-order food (i.e. pizza) a day before, according to number of participants. (don't forget to account for volunteers and execs, and different dietary restrictions)
8. Run workshop!
   * Set up 4 stations with about 4-5 Pis. (preferrably at corners of lab)
   * Start with introduction slides. ~30 mins
   * Move to GPIO section. ~30 mins
   * Rotate each section between stations. ~60 mins per section
      * 1 section > lunch > 3 sections
9. Email participants a feedback form. (maybe with some incentive)
